# TPL — Tweedsmuir Park Lodge

Three projects within the Tweedsmuir Park Lodge (TPL) system were produced. Each catering to a manual task requiring upwards of 30 minutes of daily duties for lodge or head office staff members. Leading up to and during a 16 week summer tourism season, these following projects are predicted to have saved 168 hours of manual labour tasks.


## File
With permisson, a copy of Tweedsmuir Park Lodge operations Google Sheet file has been produced to showcase the automation tasks presented below. 

### Access
![Link File Here](To_Proivde)

#### Data
Names of guides and guests have been modified to provide privacy of those involved.

#### Tabs

- Activity Schedule
    - Prior schedule production from TPL, produced with Google Sheets logic from import CSV files
- Dropdowns
    - Hosting data for **VLOOKUP**, **FILTER** and **INDEX / MATCH** for references within automation production.


## Automations

### Guest Activity Itinerary Generator
Leading up to the tourism season, head office prepares itinerary plans for each of ~292 reservations one month prior to arrival. Automating this task outputs the required visual format as a transferable email template directly from the Activity Schedule, using the current guide scheduling. This reduced the work from ~30 minutes to a few minutes per guest.

#### Process

> Pipeline Output | Sheet **'Guest Activity Itinerary'!**

##### 01 | Extract Source Data

- **'Guest Activity Itinerary'!B4:B30 - Reservations List**
    - Produce an output array of all reservations present on chosen date.
``` excel-formula
= LET (
    reservations, 'Schedule - Reservations'!$D$8:$D,                            /* All guest reservations */
    dates, 'Schedule - Reservations'!$B$8:$B,                                    /* Date column for all reservations */
    chosen_date, $A3,                                                           /* Date chosen for observe guest reservation interary */ 

    UNIQUE(
        FILTER(                                                                 /* Filter unique reservations into singular output */
            {reservations},dates = chosen_date, date <> ""
            )
    )
)
```

- **'Guest Activity Itinerary'!A27:D27 - Reservation Selector**
    - Produce Dropdown selection from the output array as Selected Cell Range to dicate chosen Reservation.
    - Data validation (list from a range): ='Guest Activity Itinerary'!$B$4:$B$26

    - Produce an array output of designated activities for chosen reservation from dates applicable

``` excel-formula

=LET(
    dates, 'Schedule - Reservations'!$B$8:$B,                                   /* Date column for all reservations */

#### Summary

The excel code provided above successfully automates a useable email template to communicate individual reservation activity interaries with up to date guided schedules.

Used by the sales team at Tweedsmuir Park Lodge for the ~292 reservations across the 2025 summer season, this saved ~5 minutes per reservation, accumlating **~24 hours**.





### Daily Lunch Form
Each day of operations at Tweedsmuir Park Lodge requires a variation of packed lunches and coolers for guest activities. Previously, receptionists read the  'Schedule - Reservations'ssheet and produced a typed/written lunch form—about 30 minutes per day for the kitchen to produce. 

The automation reduces the task to ~5 minutes per day. The procedure extracts guides, guest reservations and guests counts, transforms activity types in lunch types, and sorts by required preparation time for the chosen date. The only remaining manual step is adding dietary preferences, which aren’t available in the data pipeline.


#### Process

##### 01 | Extract Source Data

- Extract the activity time, guide and **VLOOKUP** output value for lunch type for each reservation's daily activity.

Separate AM and PM activities into arrangements of 4 columns each. Each column extracting relavent AM or PM activity data. Code blocks below are only copies of the AM Activity Schedules. PM Activity Schedule code can be found in relevant formatting between columns **'Lunch Form'!$E:H**.

> Source Information | Sheet **'Schedule - Reservations'!**
> Pipeline Output | Sheet **'Lunch Form'!**

- **'Lunch Form'!$A5:A99 - AM/PM Flag**
    - Produce Column A's Morning & Afternoon time period designation

#### Summary
The final workflow output is visual friendly printable/digital lunch form for kitchen employees to prepare during daily operations. 

This process saves ~25 minutes per day across the 16 week season, about ~46 hours of labour eliminated, to be used towards alternative operation tasks or enhancing customer service.








### Daily Activity Schedule

A similar task to the Lunch Form, the Daily Activity Schedule automates the guide and reservation activities for a chosen date. Previously, receptionists read the  'Schedule - Reservations'ssheet and produced a typed/written Daily Acitivity List for guest locations in case of Emergency Responses Protocol procedures and operational efficiency for housekeeping and hospitality preparation.  

Providing operational awareness of guest locations in case of Emergency Responses Protocol procedures, operational preparation for housekeeping, guides and hospitality.

The automation reduce the ~30 minute  per day task to ~5 minutes per day. The procedure extracts guides, activities, guest reservations and guests counts, tranposing them into a singular readable template.

#### Process

The automation is seperated into two sections; AM activties and PM activities, across six columns. The following code blocks will focus upon AM activities.
